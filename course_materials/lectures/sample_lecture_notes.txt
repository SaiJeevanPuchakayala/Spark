LECTURE 4 — Machine Learning Basics
=====================================

WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?
Machine learning is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from
data instead of being explicitly programmed. The system improves its
performance on a task through experience.

THREE TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING:

1. SUPERVISED LEARNING
   - Training data includes input-output pairs (labeled data)
   - Goal: learn a function that maps inputs to outputs
   - Examples: spam detection, image classification, price prediction
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks

2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
   - Training data has no labels
   - Goal: find hidden structure or patterns in data
   - Examples: customer segmentation, anomaly detection, topic modeling
   - Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, Autoencoders

3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
   - Agent learns by interacting with an environment
   - Receives rewards or penalties for actions
   - Goal: maximize cumulative reward
   - Examples: game playing, robotics, self-driving cars

KEY CONCEPTS:
- Training Set: Data used to train the model
- Test Set: Data held out to evaluate performance
- Overfitting: Model memorizes training data, fails on new data
- Underfitting: Model is too simple to capture patterns
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Balance between model complexity and generalization

EVALUATION METRICS:
- Accuracy: percentage of correct predictions
- Precision: of predicted positives, how many are actually positive
- Recall: of actual positives, how many did we catch
- F1 Score: harmonic mean of precision and recall

NEXT CLASS: We'll implement a simple linear regression model from scratch.
