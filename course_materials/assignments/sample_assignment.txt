ASSIGNMENT 1 — Finding the Right Book: How AI Searches for Answers
===================================================================
Due: End of Week 3
Points: 100

OBJECTIVE:
Experience how AI searches through options to find the best result by role-playing three different search strategies in a school library scenario. No coding or technical background needed — just curiosity and a pencil.

SCENARIO:
Imagine you are a school librarian. A student walks in and says:
"I need a book about animals that live in the ocean, and it should
be easy enough for a 4th grader to read."

Your library has 30 books spread across 5 shelves (A–E). Each book
has three labels on it:
  - Topic (animals, space, history, ocean, plants, etc.)
  - Reading level (grades 1–2, grades 3–4, grades 5–6)
  - Shelf location

Some books match one condition (e.g., about animals but too hard).
Some match the other (e.g., right reading level but about space).
Only a few match both perfectly. Your job is to find the best book
using three different strategies.

A book list worksheet is provided with all 30 books and their labels.

PART 1 — Check Every Single Book — 25 points
   Go through the shelves one by one, from Shelf A to Shelf E,
   checking every book in order. For each book, write down whether
   it matches the student's request (Yes / Partial / No).
   - How many books did you check before finding a perfect match?
   - List all the perfect matches you found.

PART 2 — Follow Your Gut — 25 points
   This time, pick the shelf that "feels" most likely (e.g., the
   ocean shelf) and check every book there before moving on. If
   nothing works, pick another shelf and go deep again.
   - How many books did you check before finding a perfect match?
   - Did going deep into one shelf first help or waste time?

PART 3 — Use Your Best Guess — 30 points
   Now try a smarter approach. Before opening any book, glance at
   its labels and ask yourself two quick questions:

   "How close is this topic to what the student wants?" — rate it
   from 0 (not at all) to 5 (perfect match).

   "Is the reading level right for a 4th grader?" — rate it from
   0 (way too easy or too hard) to 5 (just right).

   Add those two ratings together. A book that scores 10 is
   exactly what the student needs. Start by checking the books
   with the highest ratings first.
   - Show your ratings for at least 10 books.
   - How many books did you check before finding a perfect match?
   - Why was this faster (or slower) than the other strategies?

PART 4 — Reflection (1 page) — 20 points
   Write a short reflection answering these questions:
   - Which strategy found a good book with the least effort?
   - When might the "check everything" approach (Part 1) actually
     be better than the "best guess" approach (Part 3)?
   - Think about your own classroom: when you search for a lesson
     plan, a worksheet, or a video for your students, which of
     these three strategies do you naturally use?
   - How does understanding these strategies change the way you
     think about what AI does when it "searches" for an answer?

NOTE FOR CURIOUS READERS:
   The three strategies you just tried have names in computer
   science. Part 1 is called "Breadth-First Search" (BFS), Part 2
   is called "Depth-First Search" (DFS), and Part 3 is called
   "A* Search." The "best guess" rating you used in Part 3 is
   what computer scientists call a "heuristic" — a quick estimate
   that helps you make smarter choices without checking everything.

MATERIALS:
- Book list worksheet (download from the course portal or use the
  printed copy handed out in class)
- A pencil and a highlighter

SUBMISSION:
- Submit your completed worksheet and reflection
- Upload a photo/scan (worksheet.pdf) and reflection (reflection.pdf)
  to the course portal before 11:59 PM on the due date

HINTS:
- Start with Part 1 — just go book by book, no thinking required
- For Part 3, you do not need to score all 30 books upfront — score
  a handful, check the best ones, and score more only if needed
- There are no wrong answers in the reflection — what matters is
  showing that you understand why one approach works better than
  another in different situations
