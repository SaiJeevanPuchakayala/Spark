ASSIGNMENT 1 — Search Algorithms
==================================
Due: End of Week 3
Points: 100

OBJECTIVE:
Implement and compare three search algorithms: BFS, DFS, and A* on a
grid-based pathfinding problem.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Implement BFS (Breadth-First Search) — 25 points
2. Implement DFS (Depth-First Search) — 25 points
3. Implement A* with Manhattan distance heuristic — 30 points
4. Write a comparison report (1-2 pages) analyzing:
   - Number of nodes explored by each algorithm
   - Path length found by each algorithm
   - Time taken by each algorithm
   - When each algorithm is most appropriate — 20 points

STARTER CODE:
Download from the course portal. The Grid class and visualization
functions are provided. You only need to implement the search functions.

SUBMISSION:
- Submit your Python file (search.py) and report (report.pdf)
- Upload to the course portal before 11:59 PM on the due date

HINTS:
- Start with BFS — it's the simplest to implement
- For A*, remember that f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
- Use a priority queue (heapq) for A*
- Test with small grids first before running the larger test cases
